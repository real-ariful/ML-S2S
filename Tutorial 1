First of all, we get to know what is ML.

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based 
on the idea that systems can learn from data,identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

The application of machine learning are-
1. Facebook Facial Recognition
2. Connectivity
3. VR Headsets 
4. Iphone-->Speech Recognition
5. Dog Robot Learning to Walk(Reinforcement Learning)
6. Advertisement
7. Medicine
8. Space
9.Explore new territories

ML is the future.

You see data is everywhere. Data collected by human until 2005 is 130 EB.

Character 'A'-1 Byte
Page - 1 KB
Book - 1 MB
DNA(human genome)- 1GB
HD Camera(whole human life recordings)-1TB
Amazon Rainforest - 1PB
Earth - 1 EB

Data Volume-
Until 2005-130EB
2010 - 1200 EB
2015 - 7900 EB
2020(Estimated) - 40900 EB

Data is exponentially growing

There is large scope of Machine Learning as Data Scientists and Machines are not utilising the total data available.
